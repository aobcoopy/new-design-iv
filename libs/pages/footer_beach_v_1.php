                	If you're looking for a heavy dose of traditional charm alongside stunning beaches and ocean views, you're sure to love beautiful Bophut in Koh Samui. With bucketloads of historic charm as well as modern amenities, it's no wonder it is such a popular location for holidaymakers who love staying in the beautiful villas in Bophut.
<br><br>
Bophut Beach is located in northern Koh Samui, between the Big Buddha and Maenam beaches. It takes just fifteen minutes to arrive from the airport so you can expect to be in your villa soon after landing.
<br><br>
Upon arrival visitors are sure to love the kilometers of stunning white sand, with clear blue ocean that is perfect for splashing about in. 
<br><br>
Bophut is the third most popular place to stay in Koh Samui, and perhaps another reason for this is the gorgeous fishermen's village which is located a short walk from the beachfront. This picturesque place has much charm of yesteryear, now with a number of shops, restaurants and bars. <br><br>
The best swimming can be found toward at the western end of the beach, where the water is calm and tranquil. As well as swimming, snorkelling is also popular and divers may like to join in a trip out into the deeper waters of the Gulf of Thailand. 

<br><br>
Bophut has been influenced by both Thai and Chinese culture, and one of the results of this is that it offers some of the most delicious food to be found. There are many excellent local restaurants, and you can also find other cuisines including French, Indian, British and Australian. 
<br><br>
Seafood is a popular choice owing to Bophut's reputation as a quaint fishing village. Many of the eateries look out over the sea, which is a wonderful way to enjoy a delicious meal. If you stay in one of Bophut’s villas, you will be able to request your chef to prepare a meal with fresh fish bought from the market.
<br><br>
Another popular past-time in Bophut is shopping. There are a number of friendly and laidback shopping opportunities, including most famously on Fridays when nearly all of the village becomes a bustling market, especially towards Fisherman's Village Walking Street. All through the week, the Wharf is also a good place to shop for souvenirs.
<br><br>
Being Koh Samui's third largest resort town, Bophut offers some excellent nightlife to enjoy. Many of the best bars and beach clubs, such as Coco Tams, are located right on the beachfront, leading to a stylish and elegant atmosphere.
<br><br>
Unlike busier areas, the nightlife in Bophut is more relaxed and many venues are suitable for children to visit and perhaps enjoy a mocktail!
<br><br>
There is no shortage of fun activities to enjoy as you stay in Bophut, whether you're travelling as a couple, family or group of friends. Samui Go-Kart is located here, and is a great way to get your adrenaline fix and bring a smile to your face. Just beware, the 500-metre long track seems to bring out the competitive spirit in everybody!
<br><br>
There is also a crocodile farm nearby, as well as a lush Golf Course for those who prefer some sport activity
<br><br>
Perhaps the most famous attraction near Bophut is Big Buddha. The huge 12 metre gold Buddha is actually located on a small island, but accessed via a causeway. It's highly recommended to visit during your stay in the area.<br><br>
Another activity you cannot miss while in Bophut is indulging in a luxurious and rejuvenating massage. There are many spas where you can enjoy treatments including facials, massages and manicures.
<br><br>
With so much to do, see and enjoy in this charming and laidback historic area, it's no wonder that Bophut is such a favourite amongst those in the know. Certainly, with so much charm, there's something for everyone in beautiful Bophut.

                    Koh Samui is famous for its stunning tropical beaches and energetic nightlife - so it is no surprise that these two go hand-in-hand in Chaweng, the busiest area on the island. Here, within walking distance of the tropical beach, is a long strip filled with famous bars and nightclubs of all different types and styles, yet there are still places to go to enjoy some peace and quiet here.

                    <br><br>
                    Chaweng is on the east coast of Koh Samui and, as stated, is the most popular resort town on the island. There are many choices for everything, including luxurious villas in Chaweng Noi, on its southern end. You'll also find a great selection of bars, restaurants, and shopping.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    The airport is located very close to Chaweng, so it is highly convenient to reach your accommodation from your inbound flight. As the central commercial hub of Koh Samui, you'll have no difficulty finding transfers from the airport.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Arriving in Chaweng, the first thing that most visitors notice is the stunning beach & sea views. With a swathe of white sand that is an impressive six kilometers long and beautiful blue waters flanked by tropical foliage, it is the ideal tropical retreat.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    As it is the busiest area in Koh Samui, many of the island's most popular activities are to be found here. Of course, the most popular of all is the beautiful beach - the ideal place for relaxing, perhaps on a sun lounge under an umbrella.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    While simply lazing on the sand is many visitors' activity of choice, you may also like to enjoy activities including snorkeling, windsurfing, or jetskiing around the area. There is certainly no shortage of different activities to try out around Chaweng.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Koh Samui is also known as a diver's paradise, with many divers basing themselves here before heading out on full-day excursions with one of the many quality dive trip operators.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Aside from the beautiful beach, there are also many other fun activities for visitors of all ages to enjoy. Aquapark Samui is always a hit with families, offering many different fun water activities for the young and the young-at-heart. There's also the creative 'football golf', which is another fun activity for youngsters.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    For those looking to soak up some Thai culture, it can be found around Chaweng. Many tours are on offer, with one popular place to visit is Wat Khao Hua Jook, a quiet but beautiful temple atop a hill that offers gorgeous views out around the surrounding area. You can see no less than five other Thai islands from the stunning vantage point on a clear day.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Another thing that draws many visitors to Koh Samui and Chaweng is the promise of excellent Thai food - and you certainly won't be disappointed. From the street food at the Chaweng Night Market to the romantic Tree Tops restaurant, there is so much to enjoy in the area.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    If you want to learn how to prepare delicious Thai food in your own home, taking a Thai cooking class is a brilliant addition to your itinerary.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Once the sun goes down, Chaweng turns it up a notch and becomes the party central. There are so many options for dancing the night away while enjoying a cool beer or delicious tropical cocktail along with the tunes of some top local and international DJs. While Chaweng has many low-budget beer bars, there are also many stylish and elegant beach clubs to enjoy.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    If you need to rejuvenate after a late-night enjoying the bars and restaurants of Chaweng, you're in luck! There are many fabulous spas and massage parlors where you can indulge in luxurious treatments, including massages, facials, manicures, and more. These can also be provided in the comfort of your own Villa, if preferred.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    If you'd like a souvenir to remind you of your time here, there is plenty of choices. The area is home to many different shopping complexes, including the massive Central Festival Samui, which sells all different things within its 90,000m of retail space.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    There are also numerous markets where you can pick up trinkets, souvenirs, and crafts of varying quality - half the fun is bartering your way around and finding some hidden treasures to take back home with you.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    With such a beautiful beach, bustling nightlife, and a fantastic selection of activities for the whole family to enjoy, it is no wonder that Chaweng is a famous resort town. While there is no shortage of resorts on offer, many visitors instead prefer to take advantage of the convenience offered by the modern Chaweng Noi villas instead.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    If you want to visit, we suggest getting started planning your trip early to have the ideal holiday in this beautiful and exciting destination, as it gets very busy in the high season.

				<div class="col-md-12 nopad top21 f18"><br>
					Although Koh Samui has a well-deserved reputation for being modern and developed, it still has its fringes where traditional island life remains, and the days are slow and lazy. One of these places is in beautfiul and informal Maenam, which is a laidback coastal village with just a few restaurants and a spattering of Maenam beach villas.<br><br>

The sleepy and peaceful area of Maenam is located in the northwestern part of the island, away from bustling <a href="/search-rent/thailand-koh-samui/chaweng-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Chaweng</a> in the east. It takes a little bit of effort to get there, but those who do venture over for a daytrip will be richly rewarded.<br><br>

The area has a feeling of authenticity about it, and offers a charming and peaceful retreat to all visitors.<br><br>

Maenam is home to a beautiful, yet largely undiscovered beach. Measuring approximately five kilometres in length, there is plenty of sand for everyone to enjoy. While it may not be quite as soft as some of the sand elsewhere on Koh Samui, it still feels beautiful under your toes and the quiet atmosphere more than makes up for it.<br><br>

As it is a quieter part of the island, there are also many opportunities to take advantage of and enjoy the beach just metres away from your door.<br><br>

Relaxation is the main order of the day in Maenam, so the most popular beachside activity is simply stretching out on a sun lounge and enjoying all of the wide open space available to you.<br><br>

If you'd prefer a little more to do at the beach, there are always a few additional water activities including snorkeling and kayaking to enjoy.<br><br>

Away from the beach, Maenam offers a few exciting attractions for visitors of all ages, including the fun-filled Pink Elephant Samui Water Park, complete with a labyrinth of waterslides, and the Samui Canopy Adventures zipline which allows you to get a great view as you zip over the foliage. As the number of tourists and villas in Maenam increases, its expected that even more attractions will also arrive.<br><br>

Maenam lacks the glitzy shopping malls of Koh Samui's more well-known resort towns, but that is all part of its charm. Instead, explore Maenam's Walking Street, and perhaps stumble upon the ideal souvenir from your stay in this quaint beach town.<br><br>

Despite its modest size, Maenam does offer some excellent dining options. For more upscale dining experiences, several resorts offer excellent Thai cuisine, as well as other western favourites. There are also a number of excellent standalone restaurants, which are usually very affordably priced with fresh and delicious ingredients.<br><br>

If you are staying in one of the Maenam villas, then you may prefer to have a delicious dinner cooked in the comfort of your home with fresh, locally sourced ingredients.<br><br>

As the sun sets, much of Maenam sleeps too - it does not share the party-hardy reputation of Chaweng, Samui's largest resort town. There are a number of laidback bars to enjoy a beer or tropical cocktail - often with a beautiful view.<br><br>

Plus, the peace and quiet is part of the reason that people love Maenam. take a break from your busy everyday life and instead let your worries (and concept of time) drift away. Instead of thumping nightclubs, this place offers tranquility - and perhaps the chance to enjoy a homemade cocktail with friends in the garden.<br><br>

Another reason for Maenam's authentic charm is the abundance of beautiful temples in the vicinity of the beach. There are several stunning Thai temples, as well as a Chinese-inspired temple, which make great day trips either by foot or car. Again these can be arranged by the staff at your villa, or alternatively there are several tour operators in town.<br><br>

It is worth noting that although Maenam may feel a world away from the hustle and bustle of Koh Samui's east coast, in reality it is nearby to everything. Therefore, while it has peace and quiet in spades, accommodation including villas in Maenam are also conveniently located for visiting attractions in other parts of Koh Samui. 
<br><br>
Maenam is very close to <a href="/search-rent/thailand-koh-samui/bophut-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Bophut</a>, where you will find the charming Fishermans village and the Big Buddha statue. A little further still but only twenty minutes away are the beachside areas of <a href="/search-rent/thailand-koh-samui/bangrak-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Bangrak</a> and <a href="/search-rent/thailand-koh-samui/choeng-mon-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Choeng Mon</a>.<br><br>

So, if you desire a relaxing tropical island retreat but wish to be within striking distance of the liveliest parts of Koh Samui, Maenam may well be perfect. This laidback area retains much of its beachy charm, with a spattering of quality restaurants and numerous temples nearby. <br><br>

If Maenam sounds like the kind of place you'd love to experience, why not start planning out your dream itinerary? After all, planning is part of the fun - and you'll be enjoying your delightful beachside retreat in no time.

				<div class="col-md-12 nopad top21 f18"><br>
                	Despite its reputation as the 'millionaire's row', stunning Surin has more a laidback charm than over-the-top glamour. Join the celebrities and 1% on the long strip of white sandy beach and in the azure waters by renting one of the luxurious Surin villas and hitting the beach.
<br><br>
Surin is located on the popular west coast, so it is conveniently located for accessing all of the popular hotspots of Phuket. To the south and not far away are the beachside areas of <a href="/search-rent/thailand-phuket/kamala-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Kamala</a>, <a href="/search-rent/thailand-phuket/patong/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Patong</a> and <a href="/search-rent/thailand-phuket/kata-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Kata</a>. Just beside Surin is the long lovely beach of <a href="/search-rent/thailand-phuket/bang-tao-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Bang Tao</a>. 
<br><br>
It is also conveniently located for the Phuket airport, being just a thirty minute taxi ride away. Half way to the airport, the other side of the Laguna area and it’s golf course is the quieter enclave of <a href="/search-rent/thailand-phuket/layan-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Layan</a>.
<br><br>
With it’s convenient location Surin is also quiet and peaceful, with a 'coastal village' feel more than a bustling area. The laidback, friendly atmosphere also means that Surin is popular with young families and older visitors who rent villas in Surin to enjoy the relaxed vibes.
<br><br>
Although Surin is never too crowded, it does get quite busy in the high season. It is recommended to rent in advance to avoid any disappointment.
<br><br>
With stunning views out over the Andaman sea and a beautiful, sandy beach, it is little wonder that some of Thailand's most expensive real estate can be found in the hills above Surin Beach. The water is calm and warm, perfect for beachgoers of all ages and swimming abilities. 
<br><br>
Surin also boasts some of the best restaurants in Phuket, featuring fresh, delicious seafood prepared by excellent chefs. There are informal dining options aswell as the most famous and popular restaurants which tend to be luxurious and located within the upmarket resorts.
<br><br>
For those wishing to learn to prepare beautiful Thai dishes in their own home, there are excellent cooking schools where you can learn to prepare delicious and traditional meals.<br><br>
Shopping is another popular past time in Surin, with a number of excellent, luxury shopping brands and stores. There are a number of high-quality tailors who can make beautiful, bespoke clothing, while stores like La Route de la Soie Resortwear sell stylish, luxury items that make for wonderful take homes of your time in Surin.
<br><br>
For some more laidback shopping, drop by one of the markets located along Srisoonthorn Road. The two major ones are located near Bang Tao Mosque (Tuesdays and Fridays), and next to Lotus Tesco (Mondays and Thursdays). The markets sell a range of different items from handicrafts to fresh produce, and are a great place to see Thai life and stock up with whatever takes your fancy.
<br><br>
Of course, the biggest drawcard of Surin is the stunning white sandy beach, with the Andaman Ocean on one side, and palm trees on the other. While the most popular beachside activity is simply soaking in the sun and enjoying the relaxing atmosphere, there are many other things to do.
<br><br>
During your stay have a go at the popular sport of stand-up paddle boarding, a fun and relaxing way to enjoy the water. Or, grab a snorkel and keep a look out for brightly coloured tropical fish who live off of the shoreline. Surfers will also love Surin, as there are some great surf breaks all year round. Sun & Sand lovers can find beautiful accommodation near the sea, with plenty of Surin villas to rent that are within easy distance of the beach.
<br><br>
Once the sun goes down, Surin boasts several bars and beach clubs, sip delicious tropical cocktails in elegant surrounds. If you are looking for something a little more lively then the bustling tourist center of the island  is just twenty minutes away by taxi.<br><br>
Another must-do in Surin is to enjoy an indulgent massage with traditional oils and centuries-old techniques. There are many amazing spas in Surin, such as the Ayara Hilltops, or you can always enjoy a relaxing private massage if you are staying in one of the private Surin villas.
<br><br>
Surin is currently undergoing a number of changes and there are plans to build a large green park for both tourists and locals to enjoy. While this remains under construction for now, there is no shortage of things to enjoy in beautiful Surin. So, make your way over to Millionaire's Row and enjoy the elegant and luxurious life on offer.
<br><br>

                Although Phuket may have a reputation for its bustling nightlife, there are also a number of places to get away from the hustle and bustle and just soak in the charms of this tropical island. One of these places is Kamala. Those who stay in kamala villas or perhaps venture down for a daytrip are drawn to the relaxed and informal atmosphere of this Thai fishing village.<br><br>

Kamala is located to the north of Patong, in western Phuket. It's location is convenient from the main airport in Phuket; the drive takes just 35 minutes. Kamala is compact in size, so for those staying in a villa, it is easy to explore the area on foot - no need to worry about booking a car or booking taxis, although they are available if you'd prefer.<br><br>

While the popularity of Kamala has increased in recent years with the launch of the popular Cafe Del Mar beach club, it retains much of its understated charm.<br><br>

The center point of beautiful Kamala is Kamala Beach, which is a calm bay flanked by lush forest - making it the quintessential example of a beautiful Thai island landscape. The bay curves gently, creating a calm azure inlet that is surrounded by soft white sand. Kamala is a great location for families, when other beaches are experiencing rough seas, Kamala Beach is typically calm, especially to the northern end.<br><br>

As Kamala has not experienced the intense development of some other areas, it is possible to find Kamala villas for rent which feature beach access or are just a stone's throw from the calm waters. Many of these tastefully blend in with the surrounds, and feature beautiful Thai architecture, adding to the authentic charm.<br><br>

Although it is the quietness that draws most people to the area, there are restaurants, shops and other amenities to enjoy.<br><br>

A former fishing village, Kamala has a great selection of restaurants where you can dine on fresh and delicious seafood delights. Of course, you'll also be able to find Thai favourites such as green curry, or Western fare. <br><br>

Relaxing is the main activity in Kamala, and there are many massage spas where you can enjoy a blissful time. If you'd prefer a relaxing therapy in privacy, it is easy to organise a massage in your hotel or luxury Kamala villa.<br><br>

There is a small 'town centre' that runs parallel from the beach. There are a selection of restaurants and bars, as well as several shops where you can pick up some souvenirs of your time here. Several tailors operate in this area, who can craft clothing for you within a few days.<br><br>

A big part of Kamala's charm is that it has not experienced the rapid development of some other parts of Phuket. As such, there is a little less choice for accommodation, but it is certainly no less comfortable. There are many excellent Kamala villas available, which give guests privacy as well as convenience.
<br><br>
Once the sun goes down, there are a few good bars and the popular Beach Club. Here, you can easily enjoy a few cocktails as well as some great tunes. If you prefer, Kamala is just a ten-minute taxi ride from the bustling heart of the island, where you can dance the night away before returning to your villa for a peaceful night's sleep.
<br><br>
Sleep off any remnants of the previous night's festivities on the beautiful beach, or perhaps pick up a snorkel and do some exploring of the ocean floor. Life is slow and friendly in Kamala, so there is no need to worry about anything except what delicious meal you'll have for lunch.
<br><br>
For children, Kamala is also near to FantaSea, a place that has been described as the Disneyland of South East Asia due to its shows and attractions. There is also a beautiful Buddhist temple here to explore.
<br><br>
All in all, if you are looking for a relaxing and informal beach retreat that is peaceful and quiet yet within easy striking distance of Phuket's bustling hubs, Kamala is well worth considering. For more ideas and inspiration, why not look up some beautiful photographs or perhaps browse the listings of Kamala villas for rent.
                   <?php /*?>Just outside of Patong, Kamala is a quiet stretch of beach in an enclosed bay. There are beach restaurants and shops and Cafe del mar beach club is here too. 
    <br><br>

                <div class="col-md-12 nopad top21 f18"><br>
                	If you spend a while talking to people who have long visited Phuket, many will tell you they miss the 'old' Phuket, before there were too many tourists. Luckily, there are still plenty of places where the authentic tropical atmosphere remains: such as beautiful Layan.<br><br>

Layan is located on the popular west coast, on the northern side near the airport. Although its location is near to Phuket's hotspots, it retains a quiet and peaceful charm with traditional Layan villas for rent and a selection of amenities to accommodate visitors.<br><br>

It is conveniently located for the Phuket Airport, which can be reached in about thirty minutes. It takes a little bit to find Layan Beach (which is part of the reason it is so quiet), however signs will help you to find the way, and most taxi drivers will be familiar with it.<br><br>

The beach in Layan is beautiful, with white sands and clear waters. It is a great swimming beach, owing to the fact that a small island is just off the shoreline, protecting it and keeping the waters calm, at least during high season. Swimmers of all abilities will enjoy the conditions at Layan Beach. As the area is not as built up as some others, many luxury villas in Layan are within close proximity of this stunning beach.<br><br>

It doesn't have the largest sand strip of all of Phuket's beaches, especially when the tide is in, however it is a very pretty beach and when the tide is out, there is plenty of room to wander along the coast.
<br><br>
On the beach, you will find various loungers to relax in and enjoy the views out over the dazzling blue ocean. As it is relatively quiet, you can expect to have plenty of space to stretch out and take in the stunning, paradise-like views. Development has not been as fast around Layan as it has been elsewhere; and that is precisely why so many people think it is one of the island’s most beautiful beaches.<br><br>

At the end of the beach, there is a river where you can expect to spot a number of traditional fishing boats lined up. It is an interesting sight and makes for a beautiful photograph. In fact, if you are looking for somewhere authentically Thai, you'll love Layan, which is a popular weekend destination for Thais as well as foreign visitors.<br><br>

If you are feeling hungry, there are numerous restaurants and cafes within a short stroll that offer high-quality and authentic Thai dishes. All of these can be enjoyed with a fresh tropical cocktail or maybe a refreshing beer.<br><br>

As well as simply enjoying the serenity of the beautiful area, there are some fun activities on offer for the whole family. Certified divers can head out on an organised diving tour with one of the experienced dive shops or there are great snorkeling spots near to the shore. Another popular activity is to head out to the small island not far from the shore.<br><br>

Layan features several spas where you can enjoy a relaxing and rejuvenating massage or spa treatment with essential oils and experienced massage therapists.<br><br>

Not far from Layan is the ethical elephant sanctuary that offers safe and peaceful homes to elephants rescued from the circus and other inhumane conditions. The most well-known is the Elephant Retirement Park, where you can meet and bathe some 'senior citizen' elephants.<br><br>

Once the sun goes down, Layan has a selection of bars as well as the Dream Beach Club where you can indulge in a few drinks and dance to some great music. While the atmosphere remains laidback, the party can go on quite late so many a visitor finds themselves heading back in the early hours of the morning.<br><br>

Overall, Layan is a beautiful beach that harks back to the Phuket of old, when life was a little slower and the buildings a little shorter. Tight regulation over development in the area has meant that it is has retained much of its natural beauty, and it has authentic charm in spades; charm that is perhaps best experienced from one of the traditional Layan villas.<br><br>

So, if you are looking for a picturesque and relaxing place to stay in Thailand, you'd best start looking at Layan. Although it is relatively quiet, it can still get busy in the high season, and accommodation can be limited. It's a good idea to book early to ensure your dream stay becomes a reality.

                  <?php /*?>Just to the north of Laguna this tranquil beach still offers the opportunity to read a book under a pine tree bordering the beach in peace & quiet, or stay in your villa on the cliff or in the hills above and soak up the lazy feeling from your pool. 
    <br><br>
    The area is away from the hustle and bustle of Phuket and near to Laguna and it’s golf course. 
    <br><br>
    Convenient for the airport it’s only a twenty minute drive, so you will be welcomed into your villa soon after arriving in Phuket.<?php */?>

				<div class="col-md-12 nopad top21 f18">
                	Nai Harn is widely considered one of the most beautiful beaches in Phuket, and yet the area is still not overcrowded. While you probably couldn't describe it as totally undiscovered, there is ample room to stretch out and enjoy the long swathes of white sand. Those who vacation in a Nai Harn villa are sure to love the area's restaurants and amenities, as well as the stunning beach.
<br><br>
The area is located in the south of Phuket, so is a little bit removed from the hustle of the popular west coast. There are still plenty of restaurants and shops to enjoy along with its authentic and uncrowded feel. It's no wonder it is popular amongst both locals and Thais.
<br><br>
Its peaceful location means it is a little out of the way to get to - expect the trip from Phuket airport to take about an hour and a half, however it is a picturesque drive once you get out of the traffic.
<br><br>
Nai Harn is one of the most beautiful beaches, with a long curved swathe of soft sand, with lush tropical foliage to one side and clear azure waters to the other. Most of the time, you can expect to see a spattering of luxury yachts moored as their owners take advantage of the beach villas in Nai Harn.
<br><br>
During high season, the beach offers excellent swimming with calm, warm waters that are suitable for swimmers of all ages. The beach's location in the south means that it is less crowded than some of the most popular west coast beaches, however you will certainly not be lonely - especially in December and January.<br><br>
As well as swimming in the azure waters and sunbaking on the beach, there are other water-based activities to enjoy at the beach. There is some great snorkelling not far from the shore, and you may also like to hire a kayak or a stand-up paddle boarding for a different seaside experience! <br><br>
The beach also features an inlet lagoon which is today flanked by some people renting rowboats - great fun for the whole family and especially for those looking for something different to try. 
<br><br>
You can expect to enjoy stunning Thai food as well as beautiful beaches. There is a good selection of humble restaurants that serve delicious Thai classics at very affordable prices, or perhaps indulge in a more upscale restaurant at one of the luxury resort restaurants.
<br><br>
One classic experience to enjoy in Nai Harn is to purchase some delicious fresh fruit and enjoy it on the beach. Or, load up on delicious tropical fruits such as mangoes and dragon fruits to enjoy a private tropical feast by the pool.
<br><br>
Nai Harn is also home to a beautiful temple that has recently been expanded and is a site of great significance for local Thais. The location of this temple right in the midst of the area has also stymied overdevelopment, and contributed to the authentic feel. 
<br><br>
A little further afield, Windmill Viewpoint is a fun excursion and will give you stunning views out over nearby Ya Nui Beach. The beach itself is a quiet alternative to Nai Harn and great for doing something different if you've spent a few days at your villa.
<br><br>
From nearby Phromthep Cape, which forms the southern cape of Phuket, you can take in beautiful sunsets and sunrises, which often feature striking reds, yellows and pinks.
<br><br>
Another popular activity in Nai Harn is indulging in a relaxing and therapeutic massage. There are many massage spas that offer a range of therapies including Thai, Western and Swedish massage. <br><br>
Overall, Nai Harn is a beautiful place to stay - it's no wonder that its popularity is increasing and that it has been voted as one of the most beautiful beaches in Asia. One look at the stunning beach lined with forest and it's sure to remind you of all your tropical island paradise daydreams!
<br><br>
So, what are you waiting for? Why not start planning your dream holiday and deciding on your favourite activities?<br><br>

                At one end of the beach is Laguna with it’s many shops and cafes. Catch beach club on Bang tao beach is a great place to enjoy the sunset followed by dinner. <br>
                There are a collection of private villas in the hills behind.<?php */?>
                It's a travel cliche, but Phuket's Bangtao Beach area really does offer the best of both worlds. The southern end is a bustling, energetic place with many bars, restaurants and many Bangtao villas for rent, while to the northern end towards Layan Beach, the beach is remote and the way of life is slower & traditional.

                <br><br>
                Bangtao Beach is located in busy western Phuket between the locales of Kamala and Surin. However there are plenty of places to get away from the hustle and bustle. This also means that there is always something to do nearby.
                
                <br><br>
                Those staying in Bangtao can expect to arrive from Phuket airport in about thirty to forty minutes.
                
                <br><br>
                The diversity is partly thanks to the size of Bangtao Beach - it stretches over seven kilometers, leaving plenty of room for everyone to enjoy its soft sand and beautiful clear blue waters. The large resort of Laguna is immediately noticeable, but there is plenty of space to go around.
                
                <br><br>
                Although there are several resorts, many people prefer to rent villas in Bangtao as they afford more privacy and are often decorated in line with Thai traditions.
                
                <br><br>
                Thai traditions can be observed at the several beautiful temples within walking distance, including the Cherng Thalay Shrine (which is heavily Chinese influenced) and the Cherng Thalay Temple, which is considered the spiritual centre of Bangtao.
                
                <br><br>
                Another way to experience authentic Thai culture is to enjoy a delicious traditional meal at one of the many excellent restaurants here. There are several humble restaurants in Bangtao, and more upscale diners plus a selection within the large resorts.
                
                <br><br>
                Bangtao's most popular attraction is the beautiful, long & curving beach. Simply relaxing and enjoying the sun, sand and surf is the biggest past-time here.
                
                <br><br>
                As well as lazing by the ocean or wandering along the sand, there are other ways to enjoy the beach. Horseriding is a popular activity in Bangtao, and a great choice for couples or families. You can also try snorkelling to see if you can find some beautiful fish or coral.
                
                <br><br>
                Away from the beach, there are many other great attractions in Bangtao. The Anthem Wake Park is a unique water park set on a natural lake, where you can learn to wake board in a safe environment manned by experts. There is also a mini golf course, as well as the real deal at Laguna Phuket Golf Course.
                
                <br><br>
                If you'd like to relax after your busy day in Bangtao, there are many brilliant spas to get a treatment such as a facial or massage.
                
                <br><br>
                Once the sun goes down, there is plenty for visitors to enjoy before they retire to their accommodation. Bangtao boasts several great beach clubs, including Dream, Blue Siam and Catch.
                
                <br><br>
                There are other beautiful beaches within easy reach too, including upscale "Millionaire's Row" Surin, which is popular amongst the rich and famous, as well as the more laid back Kamala. If you are interested in seeing these places, staying in a Bangtao is super convenient as the area is centrally located for all of them.
                
                <br><br>
                Shopping is another popular past-time here and it is easy to come away with some beautiful souvenirs. There are several shopping complexes including a modern shopping centre known as Boat Avenue, as well as some lively markets.
                
                <br><br>
                A popular street market is held next to the Tesco Lotus Supermarket, and a great place to stop for high-quality yet unpretentious souvenirs is at the Lagoon Traditional Thai Crafts shop. Another popular place to shop is at Lemongrass House, a unique and colourful place that was started by an American expat.
                
                <br><br>
                There are many Bangtao villas which take full advantage of the beautiful scenery including (of course) the stunning ocean and the lush tropical plants. In many ways, Bangtao is the ideal location for a relaxing tropical getaway.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Clearly, Bangtao offers all the ingredients for a glorious and relaxing stay, with the stunning beach with chic beach clubs to one end and traditional fishermen's huts to the other. Add in a generous selection of activities for visitors of all ages, and it is no wonder that Bangtao villas tend to be booked out quite quickly for the high season.
                
                <br><br>
                To avoid disappointment, we advise booking your stay in stunning Bangtao as soon as possible - then begin the countdown to your relaxing and rejuvenating holiday.

                Stunning Taling Ngam is a place to watch the world go by. One of the most picturesque places on Koh Samui, while Taling Ngam may not have the frenetic nightlife of some other areas, it well and truly delivers in terms of natural beauty. If you’re seeking a chance to relax in a pristine and beautiful environment, you’re sure to love it here.<br><br>

Taling Ngam is located on Koh Samui’s quiet south east coast, in a relatively secluded location. The amenities and attractions of Nathon are about half an hour away, and even bustling <a href="/search-rent/thailand-koh-samui/chaweng-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Chaweng</a> is only an hour’s drive. It’s a relaxing and peaceful place to enjoy a charming break. 
<br><br>
There are other secluded and beautiful spots not too far away such as the beautiful bay of <a href="/search-rent/thailand-koh-samui/lipa-noi-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Lipa Noi</a> which is lined with villas on it’s calm and safe beach. The even quieter spots of <a href="/search-rent/thailand-koh-samui/laem-sor-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Laem Sor</a> and <a href="/search-rent/thailand-koh-samui/laem-set-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Laem Set</a> are not too far away either, there is a short cut road through local land that will bring you to these areas quickly and safely. 
<br><br>
A little further still will bring you to <a href="/search-rent/thailand-koh-samui/lamai-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Lamai</a>, the second most popular area of the island, with many restaurants and entertainment venues.<br><br>

Samui Airport is only about an hour away. The fact that Taling Ngam is a little further away means that it is more secluded, offering a little more privacy and a lot more emphasis on relaxation.<br><br>

Although Taling Ngam’s popularity is rising, it remains largely pristine and unspoiled, making its natural beauty its biggest drawcard. Many of the villas are tucked away in the lush foliage of the cliff tops, with the coast offering exceptional views out over to the Anthong Marine Park.<br><br>

For those wishing to get in touch with nature, Taling Ngam is a wonderful choice.<br><br>

The glorious beach is never far away. There’s nothing quite so relaxing and rejuvenating as spending a day watching the waves roll in on this beautiful secluded coastline.<br><br>

It is beautiful at any time, but when the sky is painted in a kaleidoscope of colours at sunrise and sunset, it is particularly spectacular. <br><br>

Then of course there’s splashing around amongst the crystal clear seawater - the perfect escape from the heat and humidity. Swimmers may also like to don a snorkel and head out to explore the coral reefs and undersea world just off of the beach.<br><br>

There are many places on the beachfront to hire canoes or kayaks, and head out on your own exciting adventure. Simply paddling around the calm waters is a thrill, or head off for one of the nearby islands for your own Robinson Crusoe adventure.
<br><br>
Another way to experience the charms of Taling Ngam is simply to go for a walk or bicycle ride around, enjoying the atmosphere and sights of this traditional area. You’ll spot many beautiful old thai houses with their distinctive architecture, as well as the people just enjoying life.
<br><br>
Since a large part of Taling Ngam’s charm is its relaxed and simple approach to life, there are less large developments than some other places on the island. Even still, there is a good selection of accommodation, including villas which blend beautifully with the landscape and offer tranquility and privacy.<br><br>


Enjoyable dining is easy to find, those wishing to head out for a delicious Thai or international meal - perhaps with a view - will certainly be able to find it in the small beachside village. There is a modest selection of restaurants serving Thai favourites. In particular, there is an excellent seafood restaurant that is well-known all over the island.There are also a few options to enjoy a casual drink, perhaps on the beach as the sun drops down over the horizon. <br><br>

With our everyday lives generally so busy, there’s no doubting the immense appeal of retreating to somewhere that offers a different kind of life: slow, simple and undisturbed. Beautiful Taling Ngam certainly fits this bill, offering the chance to totally relax and unwind in a stunning tropical paradise.<br><br>

It’s no wonder that many people fall in love and revisit the area year after year. For many, there’s no better way to spend a holiday than tucked away in a stunning villa within easy reach of the beautiful gems of beaches here.<br><br>

                The water is not deep but it is still just swimmable at times.<br>
                Sitting on a quiet village, there is a restaurant or two here, a temple and not much else.<br>

                <div class="col-md-12 nopad top21 f18"><br>
                One of the reasons that Phuket is such a much loved holiday destination is that the island offers so much. Whether you’re looking to dine out every night or retreat to a quiet beach for the entire time, there’s sure to be something for you. One of the best places to experience all that Phuket has to offer is Kata, which offers a little bit of everything.<br><br>

Located on the island’s west coast, Kata Beach is just 20 minutes away from Patong. It is located about an hour from Phuket airport, so it’s a reasonably easy and direct journey.<br><br>

Kata’s range of fun activities and calm beach makes it a particular favourite amongst families, although with so much on offer, there is really something for everyone. Everyone from couples to families and groups are sure to find something on offer in Kata, making it an ideal base for a holiday.<br><br>

Kata’s popularity means that there are many offerings for people on all budgets. From simple guesthouses to stunning luxury villas, there are many different options for enjoying all that this bustling area has to offer.<br><br>

While Kata is popular, it is not overcrowded, and retains a friendly and relaxed feel. The area boasts many excellent restaurants, cafes and shopping, it just turns the pace down a little and the relaxation factor up. There’s certainly more than enough to keep you interested, while also ensuring you return home refreshed and rejuvenated.<br><br>

Lazing by the beach is certainly a favourite activity here. The beautiful sandy beach is one of the prettiest on Phuket, with soft white sand and breezy palm trees to sit under. Here, the water is inviting and safe for swimming, living up to its family-friendly reputation.<br><br>

If you enjoy your holidays a little more active then you won’t be disappointed. While just lying by the beach or poolside is a great way to spend your time, there are many other options to tempt you. Most notably, Kata Beach is well-loved by surfers, who flock to the area, especially in low season. <br><br>

In addition to surfing, there are plenty of watersports options to keep visitors of all ages occupied. This includes kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding and sailing which can all easily be arranged by your villa, or from one of the shops along the beach. Another highlight is snorkeling or diving, which will introduce you to the undersea charms around you.<br><br>

The activities in Kata aren’t just water-based, either. Active holidaymakers will find an excellent selection of activities, from mini-golf to cooking classes, while culture vultures can drop by the beautiful traditional pagoda for a slice of local life. There are also some great hikes up to scenic viewpoints where you can look out over the island and ocean.<br><br>

For those staying in the hotels, resorts and Kata villas, there is certainly no shortage of delicious dining options that also offer incredible views and ambience.<br><br>

Many of the restaurants feature delicious seafood with traditional Thai flavours and favourites that are hard to go past. The variety is excellent so you will also easily find other international options.<br><br>

After dinner, Kata offers nightlife that is lively without being over-the-top. There are many different options, from enjoying a relaxed late night drink to dancing away beachside.<br><br>

Kata Beach is a wonderful base for your stay in Phuket, and you may well find yourself looking for some souvenirs. Kata offers plenty of excellent shopping, from browsing the breezy night market for handicrafts, or perhaps stopping by the smaller boutiques for a stylish gift.<br><br>

Overall, Kata Beach is a place that will allow you to experience all that makes Phuket such a great holiday destination. You may just join the ranks of those who return to stay in one of the many Kata villas and enjoy all the charms around!

                Many people planning the perfect retreat to beautiful Koh Samui enjoy a relaxing break and one that makes the most of the island’s bustling nightlife too. Staying in Choeng Mon makes this easy and convenient. <br><br>

Choeng Mon feels like a hidden gem with relaxed scenic beaches and town, and a variety of attractions and amenities to enjoy too. Not only is Choeng Mon itself a great place to stay, but it’s also close to the island’s premier attractions such as the Big Buddha and bustling Chaweng.<br><br>

Another benefit is its close proximity to Samui Airport. After arriving on the island, it’s just a 10 - 15 minute drive to reach the doorstep of your villa…. you’ll be poolside in no time.<br><br>

The area features a few large resorts and a selection of villa accommodation surrounding the beach area, offering a relaxing and secluded base to explore the wider area. Whether you’d prefer to be nestled in-land or just steps away from the beach, there is sure to be an option that is just right for you.<br><br>

Wherever you stay, you will not be far from the beautiful beaches heren. The area boasts gorgeous, sandy beaches that are considered by many to be the most beautiful on Koh Samui. Plus, they are typically quiet and laid back, with more space to stretch out and really enjoy the ambience.<br><br>

The beautiful beach is ideal for visitors of all ages, including young families, and very walkable. Whether you’d like to take a stroll along the shore, or perhaps stop to build some sandcastles, Choeng Mon beach is perfect for all.<br><br>

The glittering ocean offers even more activities for those wishing to get active on their holiday. The snorkelling just off of the coast is delightful and comes with the chance to spot some colourful coral or unique species of fish, while many diving trips can be arranged to outer islands. <br><br>

Other activities including kayaking, sailing, stand-up paddle boarding and jet skis, all offer a great way to take in the beauty of the area from the sea.<br><br>

To soak in the beauty of the shoreline and calm water you can enjoy a delicious meal at one of the waterfront restaurants. Not only is the food fresh and delicious, with many different types of cuisine available, the view is absolutely perfect.<br><br>

There are many great options around, with many visitors particularly love visiting one of the approachable beach clubs for fine dining enjoyed with toes in the soft sand. As well as the sea food, the fresh tropical fruit is also a highlight. It can be enjoyed in a salad, or perhaps a delicious mocktail as you watch the sun set.<br><br>

Once the sun has set, there are a few options to enjoy the nightlife here. The beach clubs gently turn up the music, and there’s often a Happy Hour to tempt you with a cocktail menu. <br><br>

You are only a short drive to bustling Chaweng too, with its array of nightlife, boutiques and malls just a short ride away so you can easily shop until you drop.<br><br>

The area is also in very close proximity to Koh Samui’s most popular attractions. The famed Big Buddha is just nearby, while the colourful Wat Plai Laem Temple is even closer. <br><br>

Other fun activities, such as Samui Football Golf and Art Samui are also not far from here, making it a great place to find something for everyone.<br><br>

Overall, the popularity of resorts and villas in Choeng Mon is largely thanks to its status as a “Goldilocks” town - it’s not too big yet not too small; with enough to do but plenty of space to get away and simply relax. While the location is peaceful and calm, it’s also perfectly situated for exploring the wider charms of the island. It’s no wonder, then, that this is such a popular place for visitors of all ages.

                A big part of the appeal of a tropical island holiday is getting away from it all, and slipping into a life that is far simpler. If this is what you are looking for in Phuket, then sleepy and traditional Cape Panwa may be just perfect.<br><br>

The Cape’s close proximity (just eight kilometres) from busy Phuket Town defies the sleepy and laidback atmosphere of the area. Nestled down at the bottom of the island, Cape Panwa offers the chance to escape it all and enjoy a relaxing and rejuvenating break.<br><br>

The area drew its name many years ago from a small traditional Muslim village near the beach. Although nearby sprawling resorts arrived, Cape Panwa remains largely untouched. Luxurious villas in Cape Panwa sit side by side with humble traditional homes, allowing for visitors to experience a slice of authentic island life.<br><br>

Cape Panwa enjoys large swathes of coastline and soft sand. Panwa Beach, also known as Khao Khat, is an inviting and picturesque beach where there’s palm trees blowing in the wind along with comfy sun loungers and umbrellas.<br><br>

Although the beach is not ideal for swimming, simply lying back and enjoying the stunning views - perhaps with a book and fresh coconut- is a wonderful way to spend the day. If you do want to get a little more active while holidaying here, there’s always the option to rent a traditional wooden long boat and head out around the shore, or perhaps to one of the nearby islands such as Koh Lone. There are also kayaks, and a few boat tours that operate from the beach.<br><br>

There are fabulous snorkelling and diving options not too far away. For divers, there is a nearby island, Koh Hae, which is more commonly referred to as ‘Coral Island’. As the name suggests, this is a great place for diving and snorkelling, thanks to the coral reef that is teeming with exotic marine life.<br><br>

Another place to get to know the sea creatures of Cape Panwa is at the nearby Phuket Aquarium. The Aquarium is great fun for all ages, introducing you to various local fish as well as other marine animals. Kids are sure to enjoy the touch pond.<br><br>

Part of Cape Panwa’s appeal is that it is unspoiled, it doesn’t have the rows and rows of restaurants and shops of some other parts of the island. For this reason, renting a villa in Cape Panwa with staff and a private chef is a great way to base yourself here.<br><br>

When you prefer to head out for dinner then there are some good options. There are a few laid back and approachable eateries dotted near to the beach, all serve tasty meals and are a great spot for a relaxed drink. 
<br><br>
In addition, the large resorts have restaurants that are open to the public, and are a good choice if you want something more upscale. You will also find a few good bars where you can enjoy a cocktail or something from the wine list whilst taking in the sea view.<br><br>

One great option to spend time out is the Baba Beach Club. There’s a dazzling infinity pool, private beach and a skybar. Sip on a cocktail, listen to the tunes of the DJ set - it’s certainly a great option for a different night out.<br><br>

Phuket Town is not too far away, with its many dining, shopping and entertainment options. In particular, Phuket Town offers many great shops from trendy boutiques to open-air markets. It’s an easy ride to Phuket Town, and there are many great restaurants, cafes and shops here.
<br><br>
If you are looking to get away from it all, to enjoy the peace and quiet that comes with life on a tropical island, then one of the beautiful villas in Cape Panwa may be the ideal base for your stay.

                Koh Samui may be well-known for its bustling beach areas, however there are still many unspoiled corners of the island where the main attraction is simply enjoying the calm and relaxation in the beautiful surroundings.<br><br>

Here, the emphasis is on relaxation, wellness and making the most of the area’s stunning natural beauty. It’s a place to enjoy a secluded and relaxing getaway, to return home feeling recharged and rested. <br><br>

The main activity on offer in Lipa Noi is enjoying the stunning and family-friendly beach. It is one of the most beautiful beaches on Koh Samui, Lipa Noi is also one of the best for young and nervous swimmers. This is thanks to the fact that the water remains quite calm and shallow up to 100 metres from the shore. This makes Lipa Noi beach perfect for families wanting to enjoy a fun and relaxing beach break together. The many family-friendly beachfront villas make everything so well suited to young families.<br><br>

While simply relaxing and playing on the beach is a delight, there are a few water activities to enjoy if you are so inclined. There is a sailing club where you can enjoy beautiful cruises to nearby islands, as well as many places to rent snorkels and kayaks to explore the water.<br><br>

The environment in-land is beautiful, with thick tropical foliage and a number of stunning locations. Lipa Noi is well-located for a visit to Na Muang Waterfall, the most beautiful on the island. It’s well worth a visit. And a dip!<br><br>

For those who would like to learn more about the culture and spirituality of the local people, there are several beautiful Wats to visit. Wat Sarum Tharam is a particular stand-out with it’s intricate traditional Thai architecture, and beautiful sea views.<br><br>

At the nearby Dusit Dhewa Art Centre you can see a selection of beautiful artworks from around Asia. <br><br>

Although Lipa Noi is a peaceful and laid back beach area, there is still a good selection of restaurants and social places. Several of the upscale resorts in the area offer fine dining, and you will still find laid back restaurants by the beach.<br><br>

The restaurants offer a range of cuisines and styles, with the fresh seafood being the main attraction. In fact, visitors from all over the island make a trip to enjoy Big John Seafood.<br><br>

If you are looking to enjoy a night out, then there is a Nikki Beach in Lipa Noi, part of the famous beach club collection found in places like St Tropez and Miami. In addition to its late night entertainment, Nikki Beach is renowned for its champagne breakfasts and indulgent Sunday brunches.<br><br>

Offering the opportunity to totally unwind and relax, yet with a few high-quality attractions and amenities, those who stay in Lipa Noi find themselves returning again and again.
