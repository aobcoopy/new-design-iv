Every couple and their relationship is unique, bringing your own stories, memories and styles together. We understand that you want a wedding that exactly reflects who you are, not a standard "one size fits all" package.
<br><br>
A Thailand villa wedding allows you - with the assistance of our experienced staff - to craft a stunning wedding exactly to your preferences. This means that you as a couple will be reflected in every piece of your special day.

	$detail .= "We know how important it is to you that you have the wedding of your dreams, and that choosing an exceptional Thailand wedding villa is the first step in making that a reality.
<br><br>
The first step in choosing the perfect Thailand wedding villa is to decide what region of Thailand you would like to be the backdrop for your special day.
<br><br>
Thailand has so many beautiful regions that it can be difficult to narrow down which one should be the setting for your ceremony. In particular, the beautiful tropical islands are popular choices for where to celebrate the beginning of your union.
<br><br>
Once you have narrowed down a general area, you may want to start considering specifically where you'd like your celebration to occur. Perhaps you'd like to find a quiet part of the island, tucked away from it all; or maybe you'd prefer to be more central, within close proximity of the best beauty spas and other attractions.
<br><br>
The next step is to turn your attention to exactly which villa will host your special day. There are so many beautiful choices, each with their own charms and character.
<br><br>
In order to find the perfect venue for your stunning wedding, you may like to think about your desired theme. Are you looking for a whimsical and rustic celebration, or is full-on glam and glamour more your style? Your own personal preferences, style and theme will go a long way in helping you to find the perfect Thailand wedding villa.
<br><br>
Another consideration to help you find the ideal villa is the size of your guest list. Like the villa itself, we understand that every couple's guest list is unique. From romantic elopements to bustling soirees, the most important thing is you are surrounded by those who make you feel absolutely wonderful on your wedding day.
<br><br>
The size of your guest list can also influence the style of villa that best suits your vision - although there is a great deal of flexibility.
<br><br>
You may also like to consider whether you'd like your wedding party and guests to also stay at the wedding villa. We offer many gorgeous properties with plenty of space so that both you and your guests will have plenty of privacy during your stay.<br><br>";
