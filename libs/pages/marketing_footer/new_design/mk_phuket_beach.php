	$detail .= "It's a travel cliche, but Phuket's Bangtao Beach area really does offer the best of both worlds. The southern end is a bustling, energetic place with many bars, restaurants and many Bang tao beach villas for rent, while to the northern end towards Layan Beach, the beach is remote and the way of life is slower & traditional.
<br><br>
Bangtao Beach is located in busy western Phuket between the locales of Kamala and Surin. However there are plenty of places to get away from the hustle and bustle. This also means that there is always something to do nearby.
<br><br>
Those staying in Bangtao can expect to arrive from Phuket airport in about thirty to forty minutes.
<br><br>
The diversity is partly thanks to the size of Bangtao Beach - it stretches over seven kilometers, leaving plenty of room for everyone to enjoy its soft sand and beautiful clear blue waters. The large resort of Laguna is immediately noticeable, but there is plenty of space to go around.
<br><br>
Although there are several resorts, many people prefer to rent villas in Bangtao <a href=\"/search-rent/thailand-phuket/all-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html\" class=\"tor\">Phuket luxury villas</a> as they afford more privacy and are often decorated in line with Thai traditions.
<br><br>
Thai traditions can be observed at the several beautiful temples within walking distance, including the Cherng Thalay Shrine (which is heavily Chinese influenced) and the Cherng Thalay Temple, which is considered the spiritual centre of Bangtao.
<br><br>
Another way to experience authentic Thai culture is to enjoy a delicious traditional meal at one of the many excellent restaurants here. There are several humble restaurants in Bangtao, and more upscale diners plus a selection within the large resorts.
<br><br>
Bangtao's most popular attraction is the beautiful, long & curving beach. Simply relaxing and enjoying the sun, sand and surf is the biggest past-time here.
<br><br>
As well as lazing by the ocean or wandering along the sand, there are other ways to enjoy the beach. Horseriding is a popular activity in Bangtao, and a great choice for couples or families. You can also try snorkelling to see if you can find some beautiful fish or coral.
<br><br>
Away from the beach, there are many other great attractions in Bangtao. The Anthem Wake Park is a unique water park set on a natural lake, where you can learn to wake board in a safe environment manned by experts. There is also a mini golf course, as well as the real deal at Laguna Phuket Golf Course.
<br><br>
If you'd like to relax after your busy day in Bangtao, there are many brilliant spas to get a treatment such as a facial or massage.
<br><br>
Once the sun goes down, there is plenty for visitors to enjoy before they retire to their accommodation. Bangtao boasts several great beach clubs, including Dream, Blue Siam and Catch.
<br><br>
There are other beautiful beaches within easy reach too, including upscale \"Millionaire's Row\" Surin, which is popular amongst the rich and famous, as well as the more laid back 
<a href=\"/search-rent/thailand-phuket/kamala-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html\" class=\"tor\">Kamala</a>. If you are interested in seeing these places, staying in a Bangtao is super convenient as the area is centrally located for all of them.
<br><br>
Shopping is another popular past-time here and it is easy to come away with some beautiful souvenirs. There are several shopping complexes including a modern shopping centre known as Boat Avenue, as well as some lively markets.
<br><br>
A popular street market is held next to the Tesco Lotus Supermarket, and a great place to stop for high-quality yet unpretentious souvenirs is at the Lagoon Traditional Thai Crafts shop. Another popular place to shop is at Lemongrass House, a unique and colourful place that was started by an American expat.
<br><br>
There are many Bang tao beach villas which take full advantage of the beautiful scenery including (of course) the stunning ocean and the lush tropical plants. In many ways, Bangtao is the ideal location for a relaxing tropical getaway.
<br><br>
Clearly, Bangtao offers all the ingredients for a glorious and relaxing stay, with the stunning beach with chic beach clubs to one end and traditional fishermen's huts to the other. Add in a generous selection of activities for visitors of all ages, and it is no wonder that Bang tao beach villas tend to be booked out quite quickly for the high season.
<br><br>
To avoid disappointment, we advise booking your stay in stunning Bang tao beach villas as soon as possible - then begin the countdown to your relaxing and rejuvenating holiday.

	$detail .= "A big part of the appeal of a tropical island holiday is getting away from it all, and slipping into a life that is far simpler. If this is what you are looking for in Phuket, then sleepy and traditional Cape Panwa may be just perfect.
<br><br>
The Cape’s close proximity (just eight kilometres) from busy Phuket Town defies the sleepy and laidback atmosphere of the area. Nestled down at the bottom of the island, Cape Panwa offers the chance to escape it all and enjoy a relaxing and rejuvenating break.
<br><br>
The area drew its name many years ago from a small traditional Muslim village near the beach. Although nearby sprawling resorts arrived, Cape Panwa remains largely untouched. Luxurious villas in Cape Panwa sit side by side with humble traditional homes, allowing for visitors to experience a slice of authentic island life.
<br><br>
Cape Panwa enjoys large swathes of coastline and soft sand. Panwa Beach, also known as Khao Khat, is an inviting and picturesque beach where there’s palm trees blowing in the wind along with comfy sun loungers and umbrellas.
<br><br>
Although the beach is not ideal for swimming, simply lying back and enjoying the stunning views - perhaps with a book and fresh coconut- is a wonderful way to spend the day. If you do want to get a little more active while holidaying here, there’s always the option to rent a traditional wooden long boat and head out around the shore, or perhaps to one of the nearby islands such as Koh Lone. There are also kayaks, and a few boat tours that operate from the beach.
<br><br>
There are fabulous snorkelling and diving options not too far away. For divers, there is a nearby island, Koh Hae, which is more commonly referred to as ‘Coral Island’. As the name suggests, this is a great place for diving and snorkelling, thanks to the coral reef that is teeming with exotic marine life.
<br><br>
Another place to get to know the sea creatures of Cape Panwa is at the nearby Phuket Aquarium. The Aquarium is great fun for all ages, introducing you to various local fish as well as other marine animals. Kids are sure to enjoy the touch pond.
<br><br>
Part of Cape Panwa’s appeal is that it is unspoiled, it doesn’t have the rows and rows of restaurants and shops of some other parts of the island. For this reason, renting a villa in Cape Panwa with staff and a private chef is a great way to base yourself here.
<br><br>
When you prefer to head out for dinner then there are some good options. There are a few laid back and approachable eateries dotted near to the beach, all serve tasty meals and are a great spot for a relaxed drink.
<br><br>
In addition, the large resorts have restaurants that are open to the public, and are a good choice if you want something more upscale. You will also find a few good bars where you can enjoy a cocktail or something from the wine list whilst taking in the sea view.
<br><br>
One great option to spend time out is the Baba Beach Club. There’s a dazzling infinity pool, private beach and a skybar. Sip on a cocktail, listen to the tunes of the DJ set - it’s certainly a great option for a different night out.
<br><br>
Phuket Town is not too far away, with its many dining, shopping and entertainment options. In particular, Phuket Town offers many great shops from trendy boutiques to open-air markets. It’s an easy ride to Phuket Town, and there are many great restaurants, cafes and shops here.
<br><br>
If you are looking to get away from it all, to enjoy the peace and quiet that comes with life on a tropical island, then one of the beautiful villas in Cape Panwa may be the ideal base for your stay.

If you enjoy your holidays a little more active then you won’t be disappointed. While just lying by the beach or poolside is a great way to spend your time, there are many other options to tempt you. Most notably, Kata Beach is well-loved by surfers, who flock to the area, especially in low season.
<br><br>
In addition to surfing, there are plenty of watersports options to keep visitors of all ages occupied. This includes kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding and sailing which can all easily be arranged by your villa, or from one of the shops along the beach. Another highlight is snorkeling or diving, which will introduce you to the undersea charms around you.
<br><br>
The activities in Kata aren’t just water-based, either. Active holidaymakers will find an excellent selection of activities, from mini-golf to cooking classes, while culture vultures can drop by the beautiful traditional pagoda for a slice of local life. There are also some great hikes up to scenic viewpoints where you can look out over the island and ocean.
<br><br>
For those staying in the hotels, resorts and Kata villas, there is certainly no shortage of delicious dining options that also offer incredible views and ambience.
<br><br>
Many of the restaurants feature delicious seafood with traditional Thai flavours and favourites that are hard to go past. The variety is excellent so you will also easily find other international options.
<br><br>
After dinner, Kata offers nightlife that is lively without being over-the-top. There are many different options, from enjoying a relaxed late night drink to dancing away beachside.
<br><br>
Kata Beach is a wonderful base for your stay in Phuket, and you may well find yourself looking for some souvenirs. Kata offers plenty of excellent shopping, from browsing the breezy night market for handicrafts, or perhaps stopping by the smaller boutiques for a stylish gift.

	If you spend a while talking to people who have long visited Phuket, many will tell you they miss the 'old' Phuket, before there were too many tourists. Luckily, there are still plenty of places where the authentic tropical atmosphere remains: such as beautiful Layan villas for rent.
<br><br>
Layan beach is located on the popular west coast, on the northern side near the airport. Although its location is near to Phuket's hotspots, it retains a quiet and peaceful charm with traditional Layan villas for rent and a selection of amenities to accommodate visitors.
<br><br>
It is conveniently located for the Phuket Airport, which can be reached in about thirty minutes. It takes a little bit to find Layan Beach (which is part of the reason it is so quiet), however signs will help you to find the way, and most taxi drivers will be familiar with it.
<br><br>
The Layan beach is beautiful, with white sands and clear waters. It is a great swimming beach, owing to the fact that a small island is just off the shoreline, protecting it and keeping the waters calm, at least during high season. Swimmers of all abilities will enjoy the conditions at Layan Beach. As the area is not as built up as some others, many luxury villas in Layan are within close proximity of this stunning beach.
<br><br>
It doesn't have the largest sand strip of all of Phuket's beaches, especially when the tide is in, however it is a very pretty beach and when the tide is out, there is plenty of room to wander along the coast.
<br><br>
On the Layan beach, you will find various loungers to relax in and enjoy the views out over the dazzling blue ocean. As it is relatively quiet, you can expect to have plenty of space to stretch out and take in the stunning, paradise-like views. Development has not been as fast around Layan as it has been elsewhere; and that is precisely why so many people think it is one of the island’s most beautiful beaches.
<br><br>
At the end of the beach, there is a river where you can expect to spot a number of traditional fishing boats lined up. It is an interesting sight and makes for a beautiful photograph. In fact, if you are looking for somewhere authentically Thai, you'll love Layan villas for rent, which is a popular weekend destination for Thais as well as foreign visitors.
<br><br>
If you are feeling hungry, there are numerous restaurants and cafes within a short stroll that offer high-quality and authentic Thai dishes. All of these can be enjoyed with a fresh tropical cocktail or maybe a refreshing beer.
<br><br>
As well as simply enjoying the serenity of the beautiful Layan villas for rent area, there are some fun activities on offer for the whole family. Certified divers can head out on an organised diving tour with one of the experienced dive shops or there are great snorkeling spots near to the shore. Another popular activity is to head out to the small island not far from the shore.
<br><br>
Layan villas for rent features several spas where you can enjoy a relaxing and rejuvenating massage or spa treatment with essential oils and experienced massage therapists.
<br><br>
Not far from Layan is the ethical elephant sanctuary that offers safe and peaceful homes to elephants rescued from the circus and other inhumane conditions. The most well-known is the Elephant Retirement Park, where you can meet and bathe some 'senior citizen' elephants.
<br><br>
Once the sun goes down, Layan has a selection of bars as well as the Dream Beach Club where you can indulge in a few drinks and dance to some great music. While the atmosphere remains laidback, the party can go on quite late so many a visitor finds themselves heading back in the early hours of the morning.
<br><br>
Overall, Layan is a beautiful beach that harks back to the Phuket of old, when life was a little slower and the buildings a little shorter. Tight regulation over development in the area has meant that it is has retained much of its natural beauty, and it has authentic charm in spades; charm that is perhaps best experienced from one of the traditional Layan villas for rent.
<br><br>
So, if you are looking for a picturesque and relaxing <a href=\"/search-rent/thailand-phuket/all-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html\" class=\"tor\">Phuket holiday villas</a> to stay in Thailand, you'd best start looking at Layan. Although it is relatively quiet, it can still get busy in the high season, and accommodation can be limited. It's a good idea to book early to ensure your dream stay becomes a reality.
