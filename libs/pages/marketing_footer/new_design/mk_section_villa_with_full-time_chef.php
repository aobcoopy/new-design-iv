                    One of the biggest attractions of renting your own villa is the level of service and attention.There will be a villa manager to tend to your every need. Shopping, transportation, excursion or restaurant
    bookings. They are your personal concierge. Then there is the housekeeping staff and your personal full-time chef in most villas.Daily breakfast is usually included, if you want to have a barbecue
    or luncheon at the villa then all you have to do is ask them to make the arrangements.
