                    <div class="faq_detail">
                    	Most villas ask for a minimum number of nights stay to be able to
make any booking. This is typically 3 nights throughout the year
although in high season this can increase to 5 or 7, and even 10 nights
in peak season. At the bottom of our villa details pages we show the
minimum nights required at the different times of the year.

villas for the next year at the end of their stay and all villas are booked
early in the year for the Christmas and New Year periods. Planning and
booking well in advance will give you the most villas to choose from.
