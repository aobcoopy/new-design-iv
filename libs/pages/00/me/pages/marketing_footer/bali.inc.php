        Rich in culture and natural beauty, it is no wonder that the island of Bali in Indonesia has become such a well-loved destination for holidaymakers. Every year, visitors enjoy the comfort of luxury villas in Bali, and indulge in all that the beautiful island has to offer.<br><br>

Bali is a large island, with a culture that is quite distinct from elsewhere in Indonesia. For centuries, Bali has been a centrepoint for arts, culture and spirituality, and this can be felt everywhere on this beautiful island.<br><br>

The land and people are beautiful. Although multi-religious the predominant religion is Hinduism. Balinese Hinduism originated in Java and is a blend of Shivaism and Buddhism. 
<br><br>
The temples and smoking incense offerings on the sidewalks remind of Hindu beliefs, their respect and kindness. This connection to spirit makes this a great place to spend some time. Visitors can immerse themselves in the laid back way of life and accepting nature of the people.<br><br>

The island is well-equipped to provide a dream holiday for visitors, with excellent restaurants and beautiful accommodation. It has many different regions, each offering something a bit different for travellers - but there are also common threads, including warm hospitality, delicious food, and natural beauty.<br><br> 

One of the most sought-after areas in Bali is stylish <a href="/search-rent/indonesia-bali/seminyak/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Seminyak</a>, where chic beach clubs and upscale boutiques can be found amongst the lush foliage. 
<br><br>
Those who stay in Seminyak can expect to enjoy Bali icons such as the beach club Potato Head. Oberoi "Eat" Street is a particular favourite for foodies, with a mouthwatering selection of quality restaurants.<br><br>

Another popular location for visitors is <a href="/search-rent/indonesia-bali/canggu/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Canggu</a>, which has a laidback feel to it’s real beach-side vibe.

Both areas are conveniently located for Denpasar airport, and you can expect to reach them in about forty-five minutes. Another convenient base to enjoy these two places is the quieter region of Kerobokan, just on their outskirts.
<br><br>




Another popular place is Ubud, Bali's spiritual center. 
Ubud is considered the heart of arts and culture in Bali, with many craftspeople who make traditional artworks. There are also many stunning temples that can be visited to get an insight into life in Bali and the island's fascinating past.<br><br>


Those who stay in villas in Bali's east region can expect a little more peace and quiet than the bustling south. Many of the towns in the east are ex-fishing villages, making them sleepy and peaceful, with great seafood on offer. Candidasa is a popular choice for visitors.<br><br>

Of course, relaxation is the order of the day in nearly all of Bali - it is why so many people love the classic experience of staying here and simply forgetting about any worries or troubles. <br><br>

Days in Bali are filled with fruit cocktails or an indulgent massage in a beautiful spa, or in the privacy of your villa. The island's warm, tropical climate lends itself perfectly for lazy days spent by the pool or perhaps on the shores of one of Bali's beautiful beaches.<br><br>

If you are looking for more to do, you will easily find it here. Bali boasts incredible cuisine, and fabulous nightlife that continues into the wee hours of the morning. 
<br><br>
