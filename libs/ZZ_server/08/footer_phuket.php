                            As the Villa marketing company with the widest choice of Luxury Phuket holiday villas for rent in Thailand we have analysed our <?php echo $last_year;?> data.<br>
                            This has enabled us to release this up-to-date survey of the average cost of renting a villa in Phuket to give a guide for <?php echo $this_year;?>.<br>
                            These are statistical averages and of course you can find great low season deals on villas or rent the most expensive & luxurious villa on the island.<br>
                            And time of year will change the cost due to the difference between peak, high and low seasons.<br>
                            We present here the average cost by analysing our data across all villa sizes over the last year.<br>
                            The average Phuket villa cost per room is $230++ a night, accommodating two people<br>
                            So the average cost is USD$115 a night per person in the group.<br>
                            For our many Australian customers this exchanges to AUD$165 as of December <?php echo $last_year;?>
