        <div class="col-md-12 nopad top41 f18">
        	We know how important it is to you that you have the wedding of your dreams, and that choosing an exceptional Thailand wedding villa is the first step in making that a reality.
<br><br>
The first step in choosing the perfect Thailand wedding villa is to decide what region of Thailand you would like to be the backdrop for your special day. 
<br><br>
Thailand has so many beautiful regions that it can be difficult to narrow down which one should be the setting for your ceremony. In particular, the beautiful tropical islands are popular choices for where to celebrate the beginning of your union.
<br><br>
Once you have narrowed down a general area, you may want to start considering specifically where you'd like your celebration to occur. Perhaps you'd like to find a quiet part of the island, tucked away from it all; or maybe you'd prefer to be more central, within close proximity of the best beauty spas and other attractions.
<br><br>
The next step is to turn your attention to exactly which villa will host your special day. There are so many beautiful choices, each with their own charms and character.
<br><br>
In order to find the perfect venue for your stunning wedding, you may like to think about your desired theme. Are you looking for a whimsical and rustic celebration, or is full-on glam and glamour more your style? Your own personal preferences, style and theme will go a long way in helping you to find the perfect Thailand wedding villa.
<br><br>
Another consideration to help you find the ideal villa is the size of your guest list. Like the villa itself, we understand that every couple's guest list is unique. From romantic elopements to bustling soirees, the most important thing is you are surrounded by those who make you feel absolutely wonderful on your wedding day.
<br><br>
The size of your guest list can also influence the style of villa that best suits your vision - although there is a great deal of flexibility.
<br><br>
You may also like to consider whether you'd like your wedding party and guests to also stay at the wedding villa. We offer many gorgeous properties with plenty of space so that both you and your guests will have plenty of privacy during your stay.

            <div class="col-md-12 nopad top21 f18">
            	Maybe you have already started exploring your options for Phuket wedding packages. In this case, you are likely asking yourself whether you should consider a Phuket villa or a hotel for your wedding venue, and why?  What are the benefits and drawbacks? 
<br><br>
Depending on your individual goals and expectations, hotels are not bad choices for weddings, but they often convey a feeling of deja-vu and been-there-before.  To be honest, hotels try their best to stick to a tried and proven method that fits THEM best, and don’t always allow tailored approaches for YOU.  They need to consider many other factors, such as group size, staff, other guests, noise level, etcetera.  So, you, the client, still contend (and compete) with other hotel guests and hotel regulations, which all have an impact on your comfort, privacy, coziness, and security.  
<br><br>
There are many reasons why a Phuket villa is preferable for your special day. Luxury villas can be elegant, modern, classic, grand, and stylish, so each of them will have their own individual charm, setting, and décor.  This  gives you so many options to find the perfect space that reflects your vision and expectations for your wedding day.
<br><br>
With a Phuket wedding villa, there are no bland cookie cutter, one-size-fits-all packages which are repeated over and over, as is often the case with hotels. Instead, your special day and the days leading up to it are  tailored to fully reflect you as a couple, and to perfectly fit your tastes, preferences and style.
<br><br>
There are so many villas to choose from, ranging from rustic homes with traditional Thai accents, to sleek contemporary ultra-modern structures, allowing you to choose the perfect option for you as a couple. All of our villas are hand-selected and inspected, and are known to us in detail, so you can have the utmost confidence that they will match your needs and expectations.
<br><br>
Villas are also a lot more private and quiet, allowing for just you and your chosen guests to be present as you exchange vows, without any unexpected or uninvited onlookers, just those you love and who you want to be part of your special day. In addition, villas are fully staffed with a small and dedicated team who you will get to know personally and feel entirely comfortable around.
<br><br>
This staff will be on hand to take care of all matters of preparations & planning, so there is absolutely nothing for you to worry about.  The in-house chefs can even cook delicious meals in the comfort, luxury, and privacy of your own surroundings in the villa.
<br><br>
Phuket wedding villas also offer a great deal of convenience. There is no need to worry about arranging transport to your wedding night accommodation, you can just simply slip back quietly to the beautifully appointed rooms on-site. There are many villas, villa complexes, and enclaves that will cater for large groups in various standalone buildings and structures, with manicured lawns in beach, garden, or even in mountain settings.

            	Finding and choosing the perfect location and back drop for your wedding is one of the most important decisions you will ever have to make. 
<br><br>
Luckily for you, Phuket’s dazzling natural beauty means you are spoiled for choice for the setting of your wedding villa on the beautiful island.  You can look out over the clear blue turquoise Andaman sea, with the sand under your toes, or say your vows nestled amongst a hilltop tropical garden. 
<br><br>
Furthermore, there are more unique and extravagant options, such as getting married aboard a luxury yacht or sailboat, or even beneath the ocean! If you as a couple can dream it, chances are there is a luxury Phuket wedding villa and location that fits the bill.
<br><br>
With many different styles of villas, from ultra-sleek and modern to warm traditional offerings, there is a myriad of choices available to you. The added value and benefit of our Phuket wedding packages is that they are totally customized to your needs, so you will have choice over the style and character of your villa, the ceremony, and the comfort of yourself and your guests.
<br><br>
One important thing to consider is how many guests you wish to invite on your big day. Whether you opt for an intimate elopement with just you and your love, or you prefer to be surrounded by all your friends and family, there is sure to be a villa or property available that meets your requirements. 
<br><br>
You may also like to consider whether you would like your invited guests to stay on the villa grounds, in separate pavilions, or whether you would prefer the entire space to remain private and exclusive for you as a couple.  
<br><br>
We highly recommend choosing a Phuket wedding villa that is fully staffed. At our villas, you will be taken care of by a small but experienced team who are on-hand and on standby in the days leading up to the wedding and after. These kind and professional staff people will ensure that all your needs will be taken care of, so all you need to worry about is enjoying your special day and time with your loved ones.
<br><br>
Another important consideration is the facilities and services provided by the villa. Not only will these be a crucial part of your special day, but they can also be enjoyed in the days leading up to your wedding, and the ensuing days once you are married. 
<br><br>
For example, a private massage space allows you to have delightful in-villa beauty treatments, and relaxing poolside with a cocktail in-hand is an ideal way to spend your first few days as a married couple. It’s certainly worth considering beforehand what kind of facilities you would like to be available at your Phuket wedding villa.

                If you are considering a Koh Samui wedding, you may have already begun your search and received some information about differing packages and venues that are available. One well-known option for a Koh Samui wedding package is at a resort or hotel.<br><br>
    We believe that a Koh Samui villa in <a href="/search-rent/thailand/all-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/all-collections/all-sort.html" class="blu">Thailand</a> is a preferable choice for most couples.<br><br>
    
    While often resort and hotel packages are impersonal and standardized, a luxury wedding villa experience is quite different.
    <br><br>
    A wedding villa allows you to craft every aspect of your wedding, tailoring it exactly to your style and personality. We want you to have a wedding where you as a couple are reflected in every decision and moment.
<br><br>
There are so many different, yet equally beautiful, villas to go with your chosen theme. Villas range from charming traditional properties to ultra-chic sleek modern homes. Whatever you are dreaming for your big day, there is surely a property that suits your taste, needs, and budget.
<br><br>
Likewise, our Koh Samui wedding villas are located all over the island, so whether your dream wedding is in a <a href="/search-rent/thailand-koh-samui/all-beach/all-price/all-bedrooms/beachfront-villas/all-sort.html" class="blu">villa on the beach</a>, in the jungle, or on a mountain, there will be a wonderful choice available to you.
<br><br>
Another reason that villas are preferable to most couples is the wonderful privacy that comes with renting out an entire property. Your wedding day is a day to cherish together, just you as a couple, with perhaps your most loved ones surrounding you. It can be quite distracting for there to be uninvited and unwanted guests at the property. With a Koh Samui wedding villa, you will feel like you two are the only people on the world, surrounded only by people of your choosing - as it should be!
<br><br>
There is also a great deal of convenience with wedding villas. In the time before and after your wedding - as well as the wonderful day itself - you certainly want to minimize any worry or concern, so you can simply enjoy every moment of this wonderful time in your life.
<br><br>
The convenience of a villa, with a small team of hospitable staff taking care of your day to day needs, and the ability to simply wander back to your beautiful Master Suite after the ceremony or reception, is another reason it is a wonderful choice for your wedding.

                The beauty of wedding villas and our Koh Samui wedding packages is that they are as unique and flexible as you are.<br><br>
It delights us to see what kind of ideas, themes and styles our couples choose for the most important day in their life; and we know that choosing the right Koh Samui wedding villa is a big part of that.<br><br>

The first thing to consider when choosing a villa is the location. Do you dream of exchanging vows with the sea breeze in your hair and soft sand under your feet? Or is the idea of being high above the beach on a breathtaking sea view hilltop simply perfect? 
<br><br>
Maybe you have a more unique idea such as exchanging rings underwater, in wetsuits. Whatever your style and dreams for your wonderful day, there is sure to be a region of Koh Samui which fits perfectly.
<br><br>
The second consideration is the villa itself. As the centerpiece of your big day, you want a villa that exactly reflects your unique style - whether it be a cozy and whimsical venue, or a grand and elegant home. You want a villa that fits your chosen theme, and which fills your heart with happiness when you look at it.
<br><br>
Another factor to think about is the size of your guest list, as this is likely to influence the property that you choose. Perhaps you are planning a romantic and intimate time with just you as a couple - a beautiful private moment shared between just you and your loved one.
<br><br>
Or, maybe you dream of beginning your marriage surrounded by the love and warmth of your extended family and friends. If so, you may also wish to consider whether you would like those guests to stay on the grounds of the villa, perhaps in standalone structures, or on other parts of the property.
<br><br>
A third and final consideration is staffing for your dream villa. All our hand-picked luxury Koh Samui wedding villas have a team of staff who are on-hand to ensure all practicalities are taken care of; meaning you can simply sit back, relax and enjoy every moment of this wonderful time. 
<br><br>
You may also like to arrange for additional staff such as a full-time chef who can prepare delicious meals for you to share with your loved ones, or perhaps a babysitter to take care of the little ones while you prepare for the big day.
<br><br>
Other options include the ultimate pampering experience, with wonderful beauticians, masseuses and spa therapists on call. You can either be pampered within the comfort of your villa, or perhaps head out to a luxurious spa for a rejuvenating and relaxing day.
